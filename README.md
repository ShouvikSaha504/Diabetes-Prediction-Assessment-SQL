# Diabetes-Prediction-Assessment-SQL
A comprehensive SQL project of diabetes prediction assessment

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive SQL project developed during a Data Analyst internship at Psyliq. The project focuses on various aspects of diabetes prediction assessments, utilizing SQL to perform a range of tasks on patient data. The project covers data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis to provide insights into patient health metrics and conditions.

## Project Details

The SQL assessment includes the following tasks:

1. **Retrieve Patient Information**
   - Retrieve `Patient_id` and ages of all patients.

2. **Filter by Age and Gender**
   - Select all female patients who are older than 40.

3. **Calculate Average BMI**
   - Compute the average BMI of patients.

4. **Blood Glucose Levels**
   - List patients in descending order of blood glucose levels.

5. **Hypertension and Diabetes**
   - Find patients who have both hypertension and diabetes.

6. **Heart Disease Count**
   - Determine the number of patients with heart disease.

7. **Smoking History Analysis**
   - Group patients by smoking history and count smokers and non-smokers.

8. **BMI Comparison**
   - Retrieve `Patient_ids` of patients with a BMI greater than the average BMI.

9. **HbA1c Levels**
   - Find the patient with the highest and the lowest HbA1c level.

10. **Calculate Patient Age**
    - Calculate the age of patients in years, assuming the current date.

11. **Rank by Blood Glucose**
    - Rank patients by blood glucose level within each gender group.

12. **Update Smoking History**
    - Update the smoking history of patients older than 50 to "Ex-smoker."

13. **Insert New Patient**
    - Insert a new patient into the database with sample data.

14. **Delete Patients**
    - Delete all patients with heart disease from the database.

15. **Find Patients with Specific Conditions**
    - Find patients who have hypertension but not diabetes using the `EXCEPT` operator.

16. **Unique Constraint**
    - Define a unique constraint on the `patient_id` column to ensure its values are unique.

17. **Create View**
    - Create a view displaying the `Patient_ids`, ages, and BMI of patients.

18. **Database Schema Improvements**
    - Suggest improvements in the database schema to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

19. **SQL Query Optimization**
    - Explain how to optimize the performance of SQL queries on this dataset.
